Here's some instructions on how I set up a zfs mirrored pool on Ubuntu 20.04. I made a similar post for zfs stripped mirror on Ubuntu server 14.04. Check out [this post](/blog/2015/06/ZFS/) of you want to see that.

### Install ZFS

The main components of ZFS are maintained as a standard Ubuntu package, so to install simply run:

~~~
$ sudo apt install zfsutils-linux
~~~

After that, we can check if ZFS was installed correctly by running:

~~~
$ whereis zfs
~~~

### Create Storage Pool

First we need to choose which disks to pool. We can see what disks we have by running:

~~~
$ sudo fdisk -l
~~~

Write down the device names of the disks you want to pool. In my case it is `/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdc`.

To create a disk pool, we run the following:

~~~
$ sudo  zpool create -m <mount> <pool> mirror <ids>
~~~

In my case I want to pool `/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdc` and I want to mount the pool to `~/data`:

~~~
$ sudo zpool create -m ~/data data mirror /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
~~~

<br>

You can check the status of ZFS pools with:

~~~
$ sudo zpool status
~~~

<br>

Lastly we need to set the correct permissions for the pool's mount point using:

~~~
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/data
~~~

<br>

That's it! If you mounted the pool in the home folder like I did, it should show up in the nautilus sidebar like you see below.

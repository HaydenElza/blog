This is an updated solution to fix common steam runtime issues on Arch Linux. The original post can be found [here](http://elza.me/blog/2015/06/Steam/).

### The Error

Here is an example of a steam runtime error:

~~~
$ steam
/home/user/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 161: VERSION_ID: unbound variable
/home/user/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 161: VERSION_ID: unbound variable
Running Steam on arch  64-bit
/home/user/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 161: VERSION_ID: unbound variable
STEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically
Installing breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1450127196)
libGL error: unable to load driver: radeonsi_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: radeonsi
libGL error: unable to load driver: radeonsi_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: radeonsi
libGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
~~~

Here we can see multiple drivers were unable to be loaded. All too often this is to due to a symlink being broken.

### Solution

~~~
find ~/.steam/root/ \( -name "libgcc_s.so*" -o -name "libstdc++.so*" -o -name "libxcb.so*" -o -name "libgpg-error.so*" \) -print -delete
~~~

If the above command does not work, run the above command again and then run the following command.

~~~
find ~/.local/share/Steam/ \( -name "libgcc_s.so*" -o -name "libstdc++.so*" -o -name "libxcb.so*" -o -name "libgpg-error.so*" \) -print -delete
~~~

### Cause

When Steam updates it frequently re-installs these runtime libraries causing the symlinks to break. As a result, when steam updates you should exit, update the libraries, and restart again. This fix is better than my [orginal post](http://elza.me/blog/2015/06/Steam/) because it is more generalized and therefore will remain effective for more people.

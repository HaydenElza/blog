This post is very different from those I have written in the past. This content is not purely factual or inherently educational, but of theoretical interest which if articulated properly may edify the reader. I am not an expert on the topic, but I can speak of my perspective, which in turn, may resonate with others instigating their own self-revelation.

### Inception

*A glance, a smile, or a innocuous mannerism which invariably is targeted at no one could quite possibly be targeted at me. At least I hope it is, but no one else is around me, so it must be me. How else will she let me know that she feels the same. The tension is palpable, like a rope knotted around my stomach and strung to connect to hers. The rope shortens to bring us together yet I wonder if I’m the only one being pulled. Finally she looks at me, first with a smile then a wave. On pins and needles as the warm feeling of relief and joy rushes over my body I begin to raise my hand and a smile leaks to reveal the warmth inside, but only to be abruptly crushed by a voice behind me as the intended approaches. Now flush, I avoid eye contact for risk further chagrin. The fantasy is broken, and the pieces lie out in the open for the astute to gather up. But I’m not deterred—we are meant for each other. I can see it so clearly. Every tooth of her cog meshes perfectly with mine, there just hasn’t been an opportunity for it to happen yet.*

The reality is the it will probably never become real. Crushes are fantaisies. We take small, real facts about a person and extrapolate to a full person with complex emotions and desires. This extraordinary capacity to fill in the unknown is crucial for survival. It allows us to anticipate the arrival of winter so we can store food. We can miss part of an important meeting for a bathroom break and figure out what we missed upon our return. But sometimes this mechanism does not work in our favor. Sometimes we fear the unknown. When it’s dark and we cannot see into the closet, our mind imagines all kinds of horrors contained within. There is a snowstorm and my brother was supposed to be here half an hour ago and isn’t answering his phone. The possibility that he is in a ditch somewhere cold, unconscious, and slowly bleeding out is unlikely yet still weighs heavily on your mind. The evoked emotional response to this mechanism largely furthers our survival, but crushes seem to contradict this.

### Requisition

*How could I possibly believe she was smiling at me; clearly she doesn’t even know I exist. I know I should just talk to her, but what would I say? “Hey, I think about you all the time.” Yeah, because that isn’t creepy, even if it is mutual. And look who she’s talking to, I didn’t think she kept that kind of company. Maybe I was wrong about her. Maybe we aren’t meant for each other. How could I be so deluded? I built up this entire world in which we could exist, together, happy. But it was a farce, a complete buffoonery that I enthusiastically entertained and could not possibly be actualized.*

There is a moment when when the veil of the fantasy is dropped and we see it for what it is. We can take action and act upon our feelings or try to forget it ever happened. Though there is a third option. We can destructively maintain the illusion.

**1. Pursue**

There is a reason why you like this person, given it is probably superficial, but attraction is first based on what we can see and is later strengthened or weakened as we gather more information to more accurately depict a person’s character. You should act on your feelings as soon as applicable, because the longer you wait, the stronger the fantasy becomes, and when reality invariably does not fulfill that fantasy, the comedown can be destructive enough to ruin a genuine connection. 

“But what do I say?” What does anyone say to everyone else? “Hey, what’s up? I hear you’re doing such-and-such later.” I don’t know. Small talk is conversation about nothing that fills in what many feel as uncomfortable silence, but what starts as mundane and customary often instigates engaging conversation. If it doesn’t, whether organic or intentional by one or more involved parties, then perhaps you don’t mesh as well as you once thought. At least now you know and can move forward.

**2. Resign**

When the fantasy crumbles before your eyes, you may decide that you were a fool and are ashamed by your delusion. You realize that reality could never meet your expectations and no matter how wonderful that person is, they are not the person you had imagined. Genuine compatibility muddled by unattainable ideals. Depression sets in and the feeling is horrible. You may feel stupid, alone, alienated, unwanted, undervalued, or misunderstood, but as long as you do not let it destroy you, it can be healthy. Low points in our life teach us lessons and, in contrast, make high points even more spectacular. Acceptance will follow and you will move on. Frustratingly, this is usually an internal struggle and no one will notice, but opening up to someone can release the burden and lighten the load.

**3. Sustain**

The last option should not be that at all. Maintaining the fantasy despite being confronted with it’s absurdity may indicate an underlying disordered state of mind. Yes we all string ourselves along for a time despite recognizing the futility because it brings us a shred of happiness if only for a moment, but there exists a threshold which if passed ventures into the territory of mental illness. If you are contemplating right now if you have crossed this threshold, then perhaps it is time to pick one of the first two options. Though most often when the third choice is selected, it is unconscious, the discover of which is unsettling. 

### Conclusion

The outcome of a crush is often disappointment. I think this is likely because we are unaware of what we are doing or, at the very least, are willing to suspend our disbelief. Eventually the lie becomes large enough to collapse and we come to terms with it. 

The sooner you pursue a crush, the better the outcome. So get out there and start an awkward conversation, get shut down, and blame me for making you do that. I don’t mind. Who knows, maybe something *will* come of it. What I do know is this: if you don’t try, then surely nothing will happen.

As a final note: fuck evolution for selecting genes that make us do such stupid things. No there is not a monster in the closet or a robber in the hallway. No my brother is not dying a ditch, cold and alone. No I could not possibly know that we are perfect for each other purely by looks. Now please excuse me while I store these nuts for winter.
